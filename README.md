## Overview
cs-311-raytracer is a simple implementation of the Whitted ray-tracing algorithm. In its current state, it is capable of drawing a .png image file containing spheres and planes with realistic lighting. Currently implemented are simple diffuse and specular lighting, as well as reflection and refraction. For additional modeling uses, the implementation includes a camera which allows for rotating the viewing volume of the scene.
