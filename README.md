## Overview
cs-311-raytracer is a simple implementation of the Whitted ray-tracing algorithm. In its current state, it is capable of drawing a .png image file containing spheres and planes and realistically modeling light interactions between these objects such as reflection and refraction. In addition, it contains a camera which allows for rotating the viewing volume of the scene.
